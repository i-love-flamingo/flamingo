# Flamingo in Production

The benefit from go is that you build/compile a standalone binary without any external dependencies.

We recommend that you do so in a proper continuous integration pipeline that runs all your tests before with `go test -race -vet=all ./...`


## Deployment Artefact
Make sure to bundle the templates and config files.
For example in a tarball/zipball or a Docker image

### Docker
Check the file `example/dist/Dockerfile` for an example Dockerfile that you can use in your application:

```
# Example Dockerfile for Flamingo/Go based Projects

# Builder
FROM golang:alpine AS builder
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache ca-certificates tzdata git && update-ca-certificates
COPY . /app
RUN cd /app && CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app .

# Final image
FROM scratch

# add timezone data and ssl root certificates
COPY --from=builder /usr/share/zoneinfo /usr/share/zoneinfo
COPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/

# add artifacts
#ADD config /config

# add binary
COPY --from=builder /app/app /app

ENTRYPOINT ["/app"]
CMD ["serve"]

```


## Running Flamingo
* Run is behind a Load Balancer like Nginx or a Kubernetes Ingress
* Upcoming: We are planning to include "Caddy" soon, so that there would be support for Auto TLS (Letsencrypt) and config/Caddyfile support.
