# Suggested Pull Request workflow

## committing

Please contribute by opening pull requests in github.
This allows us to review, and optionally squash changes to an atomic change.

We have also put together a list of [Coding conventions](docs/1.%20Flamingo%20Basics/8.%20Coding%20Conventions.md)

## Commit messages

A commit message should always start with the affected modules, such as:

`framework/dingo: add command line flags`
or
`core/pugtemplate/pugjs: update parser`

A commit message is supposed to tell what has changed.
